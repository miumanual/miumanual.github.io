- Why I need to mirror 3 or more monitors?  
- Because my boss like it :(  

## Solution   

1. Goto the Microsoft Store, and download [IntelÂ® Graphics Command Center](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9plfnlnt3g5g?rtc=1&hl=en-us&gl=JP)  
2. In the `Monitors` Tab, `right click` the main display, select `mirror` then add the monitors you want.  

That's it. The most interesting thing is that the program works well with AMD CPU. LOL...
